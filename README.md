# odin-signup-form
## The Odin Project Project 6
This exercise asks to build a page with a sign-up form to an imaginary service. It is intended to test the following concepts:
* forms, inputs and labels
* input validation
* positioning: absolute vs static
* pseudo-classes

Note: there is no actual functionality nor interactivity implemented.
